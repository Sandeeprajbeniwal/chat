Hi I have added two .dat files of client and server. You can run it in Ubuntu using the following command.
(1) If you run command for server write a - g++ chat_server.cpp and press enter after write ./chat_server and hit enter. It will listen by port number 12345.
(2) Next step for client, write a - g++ chat_client.cpp and press enter after write ./chat_client and hit enter. It will connect to the server.
(3) Similarly you can open other client window for the communication.
